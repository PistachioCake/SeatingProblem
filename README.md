## HELP for a Mathematically Challenged Social Studies Teacher

Imagine you are a social studies teacher during the first marking period of the school year.  

You have organized your classroom into tables of 4.  

During the first 3 to 4 weeks of the school year, you would like each student to work with every other student. For example, if you had a class of 28, you would like, by the end of the 3rd or 4th week, each student to have spent at least one class meeting at a table with the other 27 students in the class.  

How would you go about using mathematics to make this possible?  
Is it possible to create a Google sheet in which you could paste your roster and that it would generate the permutations? (Or is it combinations?)  
Is this more of a computer science question?  

Please post your responses and thoughts in class comments. (Or if I need to clarify something)  

Feel free to attach examples to this assignment.  

I'm going to use this method before I go to luck-of-the-draw.  

Thank you for your help.  
Mr. Bray
